# COMM4190 Spring 2024 - Research Project

## Kendall Allen

Welcome to my research project for Communication 4190: Talking with AI; Computational and Communication Approaches! For my final exploration of Large Language Models, I chose to investigate the aspects of human communication that exist within the dynamics of business negotiations and see whether or not generic LLMs could replace the role of a negotiator in such contexts. There is much discourse presently surrounding the extent to which human employees can be substituted by Artificial Intelligence, so I wanted to engage with a job that is enveloped by a communicative context that, in many ways, is uniquely "human." Negotiation, with its complex blending of verbal and non-verbal cues, strategic maneuvering, and empathetic understanding, represents several significant challenges for AI systems, so it was the ideal candidate for my paper's focus. Within this repository, you can check out my final paper, my annotated bibliography, and the explicit prompting I did with several LLMs. Enjoy!
