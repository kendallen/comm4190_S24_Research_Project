	abstract = {This article explains Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT) and its ever-changing relevance to dozens of sociological processes, with one being interpersonal discussion and negotiation. Originally a sociopsychological model exploring accent and bilingual shifts in interactions, CAT has been expanded into an "interdisciplinary model of relational and identity processes in communicative interaction." It underpins all of human discussions, and poses a serious challenge for AI to replicate, given that one must understand many implicit aspects of their audience to more effectively imitate and match their behaviors. This adds support to my paper's discussion of communication theories that are critical within negotiations.},

	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvpj74xx},
	abstract = {This article challenges the traditional view of rhetoric as solely focused on formal logic and persuasion through proof.  Instead, it proposes a broader theory of argumentation that emphasizes the audience and the techniques used to gain their "adherence" to an idea. Central to this theory is the idea that arguments are constructed with a specific audience in mind. and the success of an argument hinges on understanding the audience's values, beliefs, and expectations. This article supports the complex communicative nature of negotiations, as new rhetoric theory plays a key role in the strategies one uses to advance an argument.},

	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/2772990},
	abstract = {This article outlines the theory of social exchange, proposing that social interactions are driven by a cost-benefit analysis. People are seen as motivated to maximize rewards and minimize costs in their relationships with others. This article provides useful examples of understanding the psychology of the theory, noting how frequently it is used within negotiations and interpersonal arguments. Because of the self-centered, sociological nature of these exchanges in the context of negotiations, it leads one to consider how well AI could imitate the capabilities of a human agent who implicitly executes this theory in their daily life.},

	doi = {10.1080/03637758809376158},
	abstract = {This article explains the theory of expectancy violations and denotes how critical it is within the field of negotiations. People form expectations about how others will behave in a given situation, and these expectations are based on social norms, past experiences, and the specific context of the interaction. When someone behaves in a way that deviates from these expectations, it's considered a violation. Violations can be positive (exceeding expectations) or negative (falling short of expectations). Because of the implicit biases humans feel towards other people on verbal, nonverbal, and psycho-social levels, this theory would lead us to believe that AI could never fully act as a human agent in negotiations given its foundation in this theory.},

	abstract = {This Forbes article focuses on the place of Artificial Intelligence in negotiations, but explains the more "sidekick-like" role AI plays currently as opposed to an autonomous replacement of a human agent. It cites work done by Klen Jensen-- a negotiations expert- that uses ChatGPT to help expedite sound business deals at a faster and more effective rate. It is useful for contextualizing my paper's discussion of AI in negotiations in concrete examples, and offers support for the potential that LLMs offer in this field. The piece also mentions concerns that AI critics have regarding the technology's involvement in business.},

The tool, called Autopilot, was developed by a London-based firm called Luminate, and is trained heavily in the legal field so it can be applied to real-world scenarios. The team stresses the importance of tailored AI tools, and note that general LLMs like those developed by OpenAI, Anthropic, and more would not be useful in this context.},
