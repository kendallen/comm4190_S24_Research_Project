# Final Paper; Understanding the Communication Dynamics of Business Negotation and AI's Ability to Replicate the Capabilities of a Human Agent 

## By: Kendall Allen 

Business negotiations constitute a fundamental aspect of organizational interactions, playing a pivotal role in decision-making, resource allocation, and value creation. Effective negotiation entails more than just the exchange of proposals and concessions; it hinges upon adept communication skills, strategic understanding, and interpersonal sensitivity. This paper seeks to delve into the intricate communication dynamics that underpin successful business negotiations, offering insights into theoretical frameworks, practical strategies, and emerging trends in the field, before looking to gauge AI's current ability to mimic the role of a human agent in this communicative context.

Communication theories serve as fundamental frameworks for understanding the intricate dynamics of negotiation processes. These theories illuminate the ways in which communication shapes interactions, influences decision-making, and facilitates the exchange of information and resources. Several prominent theories that offer valuable insights into negotiation dynamics are those of social exchange, rhetoric, communication accommodation, and expectancy violation.

Developed by sociologist George Homans (1958) and further expanded by Peter Blau (1964), social exchange theory posits that human interactions are based on the principle of reciprocity, wherein individuals seek to maximize rewards and minimize costs. In the context of negotiations, this theory elucidates how parties engage in a give-and-take process, exchanging concessions and offers in pursuit of mutually beneficial outcomes. According to social exchange theory, communication serves as the primary mechanism through which negotiators signal their preferences, interests, and willingness to cooperate. By understanding the underlying motivations and incentives driving each party, negotiators can strategically leverage communication to achieve favorable agreements while maintaining relational harmony.

Originating from ancient Greek philosophy, rhetoric theory explores the art of persuasive communication and argumentation. Within negotiation contexts, rhetoric theory emphasizes the strategic use of language, logic, and emotion to sway opinions, build consensus, and advocate for one's interests (Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969). Negotiators leverage rhetorical techniques such as framing, storytelling, and appeals to ethos, pathos, and logos to construct persuasive arguments, influence perceptions, and shape the negotiation agenda. By mastering the principles of rhetoric, negotiators can effectively communicate their positions, mitigate resistance, and achieve favorable outcomes in negotiations.

Created by Howard Giles (1973), communication accommodation theory argues that individuals adjust their communication styles and behaviors to align with those of their interaction partners. In negotiation settings, communication accommodation theory elucidates how negotiators adapt their language, gestures, and interpersonal strategies to establish rapport, build trust, and bridge cultural and social differences (Giles et al., 1991). Through accommodative behaviors such as mirroring, convergence, or divergence, negotiators signal solidarity, respect, and understanding, thereby fostering positive interpersonal dynamics and enhancing the likelihood of successful negotiation outcomes.

Initially established by communication scholar Judee Burgoon (1978), expectancy violation theory investigates how deviations from social norms and expectations influence interpersonal perceptions and outcomes. In negotiations, expectancy violation theory highlights the role of non-verbal communication cues, such as proxemics, eye contact, and vocal intonation, in shaping impressions and fostering relational dynamics (Burgoon & Hale, 1988). Negotiators strategically manage their non-verbal behavior to convey credibility, dominance, or warmth, thereby either conforming to or challenging their counterparts' expectations. By understanding the nuances of expectancy violation theory, negotiators can leverage non-verbal communication to manage impressions, build rapport, and navigate the social intricacies of negotiation interactions.

These communication theories offer insights into the multifaceted nature of negotiation interactions, providing negotiators with theoretical frameworks and practical strategies for navigating complex communication dynamics, fostering collaboration, and achieving mutually beneficial outcomes. By integrating principles from theories of social exchange, rhetoric, communication accommodation, and expectancy violation, negotiators can enhance their communication effectiveness and strategic agility in diverse negotiation contexts. Yet, it is exactly these theories that present such challenges for AI in negotiating on behalf of firms. 

Because most Large Language Models are meant to be helpful assistants, being tasked with engaging in dynamically complex, self-serving, and unforthcoming behaviors is diametrically opposed to their inherent purpose. Still, before moving into hypothesizing about and engaging with LLM prompting, it will be useful to move past intangible theories and examine the explicit steps of negotiation to outline exactly what people expect from such interactions in a more concrete way. 

As per Harvard Business School, negotiation is comprised of four steps and engages several concepts with which all professional negotiators are familiar. These steps and terms are defined as follows: 

1. Preparation
Before the negotiation, define your:

Zone of possible agreement (ZOPA): The range in which you and other parties can find common ground.
Best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA): Your ideal course of action if an agreement isn’t possible.
Walkaway: The line where ending the negotiation is better than making a bad deal.
Stretch goal: The best-case scenario for the negotiation’s outcome.
Once you’ve defined these, consider your counterpart’s perspective. What might their walkway or BATNA be? By doing so, you can set yourself up to strategize appropriately and make emotionally intelligent choices.

Additionally, determine your approach based on your and your counterpart’s expected motivations and goals. The strategies you choose should shift with the situation, but it’s important to consider them in advance.

2. Bargaining
The bargaining stage, or the discussion, is what typically comes to mind when you think of negotiation. It’s about creating value for both you and other parties despite your differences. It requires finding the ZOPA and working within it to claim the value needed to make the negotiation worthwhile.

3. Closing
Closing a negotiation can mean coming to an agreement or ending without reaching one. How a negotiation closes depends on each person’s motivations, requirements, and goals, as well as your relationship throughout the discussion.

4. Learning from Your Experience
Finally, reflect on the experience. Notice what went well, what didn’t, and what you’d try differently next time. This final step can help identify your strengths and weaknesses as a negotiator so you can sharpen and strengthen your skills.

With this understanding of the underlying communication theories of negotiation and its fundamental/expected structure, it is time to shift the analysis to focus on the potential opportunities and challenges for Artifical Intelligence within this communicative context. As outlined, there are many dynamics at play within negotiation, and it can be theorized that AI will find the interpersonal, self-serving, nonverbal aspects of the concept challenging. Still, there has been some work done recently experimenting with LLMs as negotiation "sidekicks," with negotiation expert Keld Jensen alleging that artificial intelligence like ChatGPT can help people reach better deals more quickly. In his research, though, ChatGPT never functioned as the sole operative that replaced human negotiators; instead, it helped analyze potential decisions and offers while offering empirical insights into certain choices. 

Expanding beyond advisory roles, AI was used for the first time in November 2023 to negotiate a contract entirely on its own, with two platforms autonomously negotiating a Non-Disclosure Agreement between themselves. British AI firm Luminance developed its own LLM-- Autopilot-- to handle such day-to-day negotiations, looking to free up lawyers and allow them to invest their time in more projects. The platform is tailored to the legal industry, making it better suited for this kind of context than more general-purpose LLMs like OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc. The company's team of analysts believe that other firms will soon "leverage domain-specific and/or private datasets (eg data curated during the course of business) to turn general-purpose large language models (LLMs) into domain-specific ones." 

To better understanding the vulnerabilities of these general LLMs in the context of negotiations, I engaged with two of the largest models that currently exist; ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Gemini (Google). Given the privacy around the training that went into Autopilot, I believed it would be interesting to analyze the basic tendencies, assumptions, behaviors, and biases of these models to see what leaves them presently unfit for contract negotiation at the level executed by Luminance's private tool.
